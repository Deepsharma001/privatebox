    <h5><b>Vedanta is a philosophy which enunciates the eternal principles of life and living. Living is an art, a skill, a technique. Few have understood it to be so in the span of human history. Nevertheless, you need to learn and practise the technique of living. As you would for playing a musical instrument or flying an aircraft.</b></h5>
    <h5>The world today is unaware of this process of learning. It is not taught in a school or university. Nor in a moral or religious institution. Thus people go through a mechanical way of living merely following a routine of their predecessors. They lack this fundamental knowledge of living. And become victims of stress and strain.</h5>
    <h5>After decades of intense research, an outstanding contribution of A. Parthasarathy is translation of subtle philosophic themes into practical techniques of Self-management that increase productivity and reduce stress for the modern human being.</h5>
